# Research-Flowcharts-Pseudocode Antonio Ruiz Nolasco and Isai Massa Mandujano

(4 points total) Research about the syllabus, the first three topics described in detail in the past sessions. Just send the github-link of the markdown file. It must contain all of the subjects and some chunks of code where you think is ok.

(3 points total) Flowcharts of 6 problems, three from some source and three free for you to create. Each one must contain a cycle and two extra conditionals. Upload each one as a jpg files with names without blanc spaces. Ex. "flowchart1.jpg".

(4 points total) Pseudocode of the flowcharts. And two extra pseudocodes different from the ones seen in class.  Make sure to share them in discord to evict copying the same exercise twice with another student from the class. You can comment with "##" symbols. 

# Fundamental concepts:
### Algorithim: 
Is a **series of steps** that you have to follow in order to comple a task.
### Characteristics:

# Algorithm representation:

### Differentiate control structures in the design and construction of an algorithm:
- Selective structures
- Repetitive structures
- nested structures

### Describe the types of algorithm representation:
- Graph: Flow chart
- Written: pseudocode ** 

# Data types and expressions: 
### Define the characteristics of the variables and constants

### Types of computational data:
